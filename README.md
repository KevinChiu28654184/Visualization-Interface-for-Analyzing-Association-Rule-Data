# Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing causal relationships within large datasets and accelerating exploratory analysis through visualizations. By presenting complex causal structures visually, the system enhances interpretability and supports more efficient data-driven decision-making.
# Features

- Developed in Python, the system imports CSV datasets and applies established algorithms to visualize causal relationships.
- Users can select multiple tags via a dropdown menu to filter and simplify the causal graphs according to their needs, making it easier to identify key causal links and their strengths.
- The interface supports page management, allowing users to create or close tabs for analyzing different data subsets simultaneously.
- The system highlights the top five strongest causal rules, helping users focus on the most significant relationships.

# Usage Instructions

1. Open File:
   
   Select the CSV file you wish to analyze(The CSV file must include three columns: antecedents, consequents, and odds ratio.) 
2. Select Tags (Multi-select): 
   
   Use the dropdown menu to select tags. After checking the desired tags, click "add" to include them in the analysis. You can add multiple tags for simultaneous analysis, and the system will generate a distribution chart containing data for all selected tags.
3. Browse and Manage Tabs: 
   
   Create new tabs to analyze different data groups or close the current tab as needed.
4. View Causal Relationships:

    The system will display a distribution chart of causal relationships and list the top five strongest causal rules, including both antecedents and consequents.
